# CurrencyConverterSwiftUI

About

•  This application has been made for Rakuten Viki as an assignment by Sasith Priyankara.

Functionality

•  Conversion works bi-directionally similar to the Google currency calculator.

•  Change of 'any amount' will reflect on other currency amount.

•  Change of the 'base currency code' will reflect on target currency amount.
•  But, change of 'target currency code' will reflect on its 'own amount'. (First amount remain intact).
•  The 'Read more about [pair]' button redirects to respective google page for selected pair. (This is an additional work and not a requirement of the assignment).
