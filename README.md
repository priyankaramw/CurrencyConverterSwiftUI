* Alert: Currency conversion rates are accurate only for the past 24 hours due to the free tier limitations of the API used. 

About App:

•  This application has been made as a sample app for testing purposes by Sasith Priyankara.

Functionality:

•  Conversion works bi-directionally similar to the Google currency calculator.

•  Change of 'any amount' will reflect on other currency amount.

•  Change of the 'base currency code' will reflect on target currency amount.

•  But, change of 'target currency code' will reflect on its 'own amount'. (First amount remain intact).

•  The 'Read more about [pair]' button redirects to respective google page for selected pair. (This provides real time conversion rate.)


Currency Service:

•  App uses https://app.exchangerate-api.com/ and, free license is being used."

•  The app fetch conversion rate on app loading and on either currency code change only."

Thank you...!
